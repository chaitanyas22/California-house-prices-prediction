# California-house-prices-prediction

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict house prices in California based on various features such as location, number of bedrooms, ocean proximity, and more.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices in California. The dataset used contains information on house attributes, and the task is to predict the price of a house given these features. This project demonstrates how to preprocess data, train a model, and evaluate its performance.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is based on the California housing dataset available in scikit-learn. It contains information about house prices in California, including attributes such as:

Longitude
Latitude
Housing median age
Total rooms
Total bedrooms
Population
Households
Median income
Ocean Proximity
Housing median price (target variable)

# Libraries Used

This project makes use of several Python libraries, including:

pandas – for data manipulation and analysis
numpy – for numerical operations
scikit-learn – for machine learning models and evaluation
matplotlib and seaborn – for data visualization
